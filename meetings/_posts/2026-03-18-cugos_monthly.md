# CUGOS Lightning Talks

By popular demand, we are doing **lightning talks** this month! Here's how it works:

* Share a one-sentence description of your topic to [hello@cugos.org](mailto:hello@cugos.org), or [edit this page](https://github.com/cugos/cugos.github.com?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing) to get on the agenda. This is a great opportunity to share rough drafts, open questions, or silly sidequests.
* Each presenter has **5 minutes** to share their topic, with a firm cutoff
* All presentation types are welcome---no need for slides if you don't want them
* After the talk ends, we'll have time for one or two questions while the next person sets up.
* We'll leave some open time at the end of the meeting for informal discussions and follow-up. If you presented an open question, bring your computer so people can help you solve it!
